## About

Dot Dash is a modern take on the classic pen-and-paper game from our school days. Players take turns connecting dots on a grid, aiming to complete squares and mark their territory. It's a perfect blend of strategy, foresight, and a dash of nostalgia!

## Features

-   üì± Responsive design for both desktop and mobile play
-   üé® Customizable player names and grid size
-   üèÜ Score tracking
-   üåì Light and dark mode support

## How to play

1. The game starts with a grid of dots.
2. Players take turns connecting two adjacent dots with a line.
3. When a player completes a square, they claim it by placing the first letter of their name inside.
4. The player with the most claimed squares at the end wins!

## Roadmap

-   [ ] Time Mode: each player has a limited time to complete connect the dots.

    -   [ ] 3-player mode
    -   [ ] 4-player mode
